                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>Ever since a young age, I have loved technology. Technology has done so much to help level the playing field for me and others with disabilities. In school, computers have allowed me to keep pace with my sighted peers. Now, devices like apps on my phone or smart glasses describe my environment: helping me navigate, understand imagery for myself, and be more independent.</p>

                <h2>My Draw to This Project</h2>
                <p>My passion for technology now involves AI and mixed reality, which has drawn me to studying this for my master's degree. I want to create the Environment Reader so we can make mixed and virtual reality accessible now, not later. A lightweight pair of immersive glasses or a VR headset can do so much for anyone, and there are also so many applications for people who are blind or visually impaired. Finding ways to use these devices to navigate the physical world, as well as the virtual world, is important to me.</p>
