                <p>
                    Welcome to the environment reader project, pushing screen readers to read the room, literally. The environment reader project aims to create a VR screen reader that is made for 3D environments. Traditional screen readers are designed mainly for 2D navigation on devices like smartphones and tablets. While this design language works for flat surfaces, it breaks the immersive feel of VR and makes navigation difficult. The environment reader blends AI, spatial audio, and haptics to assist a user in navigating VR intuitively.

                    <h4>AI Implementation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI enables the environment reader to adapt dynamically to any space or app.</li>
                        <li>Functions as an AI agent/companion that answers questions about virtual space.</li>
                        <li>Works with read and write access to the user’s VR environment (with permission).</li>
                        <li>Assists with: Traveling through VR, designing a virtual space, finding others to socialize with, using VR apps, and other tasks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Audio and Haptics</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spatial Audio:</strong> Uses audio icons for 3D grid exploration; allows users to locate objects in space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Haptics:</strong> Provide a tactile layer for objects; makes navigation feel realistic.</li>
                        <li>Audio and haptics empower users to navigate VR on their own terms.</li>
                    </ul>
